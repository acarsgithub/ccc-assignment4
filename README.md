# ccc-assignment4

The base of this assignment can be retrieved from the assignment 3 github submission. 

The assignment 3 github submission contains all of the necessary information to run zookeeper, kafkas, and consumer files using docker compose. 

Additionally, we have included the modifications within this repository for the information relating to map reduce. All of the code was modified to work for the energy problem, and following the instructions in the readme for the map reduce folder should result in a fully functional map reduce component!
